        Your aim is to design a communication plan that will be shared with pairs of other participants.
        <!--We hired you to design a communication plan as part of a game. On top of you, we will also hire two additional players who will observe
        the communication plan you will design while playing the game.-->
    </p>

    <p>
        These participants will receive a monetary endowment of 10 tokens. <br>
        They will need to decide how many of the 10 tokens to contribute to a <b>shared account</b>.
        Any tokens not contributed to the shared account will automatically belong to their <b>private account</b>.
        Once allocation decisions are made, both participants will receive sum of the contributions to the shared account
        <b>multiplied by a return factor</b> on top of the tokens they kept in their private account.
    </p>

                Player 1's earning will be the sum of:
                <ul>
                    <li> the tokens you kept in their private account </li>
                    <li> the total of Player 1 and Player 2’s contributions to the shared account multiplied by the return factor </li>
                </ul>
                In other words, Player 1's earnings will be calculated as follows:
                $$\text{P1's earnings} = (10\ - \text{ P1's contribution to the shared account })\ +\ \text{return factor}\ * \text{ total contribution to the shared account} $$
                with \( \text{ total contribution to the shared account }  = \text{P1's contribution to the shared account} +
                \text{ P2's contribution to the shared account}\)
            </div>
    </details>

    <p>
        Note that if both players contributes equally to the shared account, they will both earn more tokens than if they both
        contribute nothing. It is therefore mutually beneficial for every participant to contribute more to the shared account.<br>
        With a return factor smaller than 1, if one participant does not contribute to the shared account while the other does, they will earn even more.
        However, they will harm the other player who will lose more than what they gain.<br>
        With a return factor greater than 1, it is always beneficial to allocate every token to the shared account.
    </p>

    <p>
        Importantly, both players will make their contribution decision without observing the value of the return factor. <b>This is where you will intervene.</b>
