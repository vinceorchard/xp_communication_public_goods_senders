    <p>
        This experiment will take approximately 5 minutes to complete. </p>
    <p> As part of this experiment, we will hire two other individuals on prolific on top of you.
        These two players will play a game. However, they will not observe one parameter that will affect their income.
        You will observe this parameter. Your role will be to communicate about the value of this parameter given your own
        objectives.
    </p>
    <p> At the end of the game, you will receive a show-up fee of $X. On top of this show up fee, you can also earn a bonus payment of at least X$
        and up to $X depending on the outcome of the game. </p>
    <p>
        Instead of using dollars in the game, we will use tokens. All your earnings from the game will be calculated in tokens. At the end of the game,
        the total number of tokens you have earned will be converted to dollars and paid to your
        Prolific account at the following rate:
        $$ 1\text{ token}  = $X $$ </p>
    <p>
    <p>
        To process the payment, we will collect your Prolific ID at the end of the experiment.
    </p>

<!-- Should we add here that we will screen out without paying people who do not pass the tests? -->
