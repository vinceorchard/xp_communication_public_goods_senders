    <p>
        The game played by the two other players is divided into two phases, each of which is further divided into several rounds.
    </p>

    <p> At the start of each round, the players will be grouped in pair and receive an endowment of 10 tokens. <br>
        They will need to decide how many of these 10 tokens to contribute to a group project and how many
        to keep for themselves. <br>
        Any token that is not invested in the common project automatically belongs to the players and earns them one
        token at the end of the round.
    </p>

    <p>
        The contributions of the two players to the common project will be summed to determine their group's total contribution.
        On top of the tokens they kept for themselves, they will receive the group's total contribution multiplied by a number \( \gamma \). <br/>
        The value of \( \gamma \) will be either 0.6 or 0.9.
    </p>

            Your total payoff after each round will be the sum of:
            <ul>
                <li> the fraction of your endowment that you have kept for yourself </li>
                <li> the total group project contributions multiplied by the factor \( \gamma \) </li>
            </ul>
            In other words, your earnings will be calculated as follows:
            $$\text{earnings} = (10\ - \text{ your contribution to the group project })\ +\ \gamma\ * \text{ total contribution to the group project} $$
        </div>
</details>


    <p> Examples:
        <ul>
            <li> Imagine that the two players contribute their full endowment (i.e., 10 tokens each) and that the value of the multiplier
                \( \gamma \) is 0.6. The total contribution to the group project is 20 tokens. They would receive
                \(0.6 * 20 = 12 \text{ tokens}\) from the group project. Hence, their total payoff would be \((10-10) + 12 = 12\text{ tokens}\). </li>
            <li> Imagine that the two players contribute nothing (i.e. 0 token) and that the value of the multiplier \( \gamma \) is 0.6.
                The total contribution to the group project in the group is 0 token. They would receive
                \(0.6 * 20 = 12 \text{ tokens}\) from the group project. Hence, their total payoff would be \((10- 0) + 0 = 10 \text{ tokens} \).
                </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<!-- Need to discuss this last paragraph since we are somehow priming the players to be cooperative -->

    <p>
        As you can see from the examples above, if everyone contributes to the group project, they will all earn more tokens than if everyone
        contributes nothing and keeps all their tokens to themselves, even with a low value of \(\gamma\). It is therefore beneficial for
        everyone to contribute more to the group project. <br/>
        Neverthless, if the one of the two player contributes to the group project and the other keep all their tokens to themselves,
        then they earn even more, but this will harm the other player.
