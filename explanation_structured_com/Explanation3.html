    <p>
        The profitability of the common project depends on the value of the multiplier \( \gamma \). <br/>
        In some rounds, the contributor will not observe the value of this multiplier. This will be when you intervene.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will observe the value of the multiplier \( \gamma \). <br>
        Your aim will be to design a communication plan to encourage contributions to the group project. <br>
        The two players will not observe the value, but they will observe your communication plan.
        Your earnings will be equal to the total number of tokens contributed by the two players in the group project.
         <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The communication plan consists in choosing which message the two players will receive among one of the following messages:
        <ul>
            <li> The value of \( \gamma \) is 0.6 </li>
            <li> The value of \( \gamma \) is 0.9 </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now that we've explained you the game played by the two contributors as well as the task that
        you will have to complete, in the next page, we will present you with hypothetical situations and
        ask you some questions to ensure that you have fully understood these instructions. <br/>
