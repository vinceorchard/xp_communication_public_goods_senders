        We hired you to design a communication plan as part of a game. On top of you, we will also hire two additional players who will observe
        the communication plan you will design while playing the game.
    </p>

    <p>
        For you to understand what will be your role in this game and how to design your communication plan, we will first
        introduce you the game played by the two other players then explain to you how to design your communication plan.
