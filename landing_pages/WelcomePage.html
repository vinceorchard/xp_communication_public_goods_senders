        This experiment will take approximately 5 minutes to complete and allow you to earn from $XX up to $XX. </p>

    <p>

        The experiment consists of designing a persuasive communication plan that will be presented to other participants who are also recruited via Prolific.<br>
        These participants will make decisions about how to allocate a monetary endowment.
        The exact amount you will earn at the end of the experiment will depend on the allocation decisions made by these participants,
        which you can influence through the communication plan you share with them.
        <!-- As part of this experiment, we will hire two other individuals on prolific on top of you.
        These two players will play a game. However, they will not observe one parameter that will affect their income.
        You will observe this parameter. Your role will be to communicate about the value of this parameter given your own
        objectives.-->
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of using dollars, tokens will be used for the allocation decisions.
        At the end of the experiment, the total number of tokens you have earned will be converted to dollars and paid to your
        Prolific account at the following rate:
        $$ 1\text{ token}  = $X $$
    </p>

    <p>
        To process the payment, we will collect your Prolific ID at the end of the experiment and you will receive a completion fee of X tokens.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will process your payment as soon as possible, but it may take up to 48 hours before it appears in your Prolific account.
        <br>
        If you have not received your payment after 48 hours, please contact us.
