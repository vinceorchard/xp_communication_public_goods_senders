        The computer will randomly choose the value of the return factor which can be <b>either 0.6 or 1.1 with equal probability</b>. <br>
        The selected value will not be observed by the two players. However, they will know the value is selected by the computer.
    </p>


    <p>
        You will observe the value of the return factor. <br>
        Your will have to design a communication plan that will be shown to the other two participants when they
        will make their allocation decision. <br>
        Your earnings will be equal to the sum of the tokens Player 1 and Payer 2 decide to allocate to the shared account.
    </p>

    <p>
        To communicate with Player 1 and Player 2, for each value of the return factor,
        you will design a communication plan that consists in:
        <ol>
            <li> <b>Choosing which message to send from the options below</b>:
                    <ul>
                        <li> The return factor is 0.6 </li>
                        <li> The return factor is 1.1 </li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <li> <b>Drafting a short text message</b> </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now that we have explained the game played by the two other players, your role and how you will be paid,
        the next page will present hypothetical situations and ask questions to check your understanding of the instructions. <br/>
